# DSA Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and code snippets for learning Data Structures and Algorithms.  
I update it regularly as I go through different concepts and problem-solving patterns.

## About this repository

- Covers core DSA topics such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
- Each topic folder includes explanations, approaches, and code samples.
- Notes are written in simple markdown format for easy reference.
- The goal is to document understanding, not just solutions.
