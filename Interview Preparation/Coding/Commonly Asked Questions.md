- Given a random string of alphabets check if it's possible to make a palindrome or not - optimise it 
- It was to find a top k most frequently viewed items in a list.. it was a simple hashmap problem

- We are given an access log where each entry consists of a timestamp and a customer ID. Our goal is to count the number of repeat customers, defined as customers who have used the feature on more than one distinct day.

✅ [Salesforce](https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce/) = hashmap, heap, string manipulation, and recursion.  
Expect edge cases and real-world data constraints. I used this company-tagged problem list to spot repeated trends.  
✅ [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/) = loves recursion and trees.  
Think: backtracking, permutations, and k-ary structures. This LeetCode list helped me master their common types.  
✅ [Amazon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon/) = sliding windows, greedy, and 2 pointers.  
They test for speed and optimization. Use this Grokking course to drill patterns like sliding window and merge intervals until they’re second nature.  
✅ [Meta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meta/) = graphs and BFS/DFS variants.  
Trust me, you can’t fake graph intuition. NeetCode’s graph sheet was a game-changer for me.  
✅ [Uber](https://www.linkedin.com/company/uber-com/) = dynamic programming, interval scheduling, and graphs.  
They care about your ability to model real-world systems. Practice problems involving route planning, time optimization, and caching logic.
