𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐔𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 (𝟓-𝟖 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐬): Read the problem statement twice to avoid confusion. Ask the interviewer if anything is unclear.  
𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 (𝟓-𝟏𝟎 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐬): Start with a brute-force solution and work toward the optimal approach. Discuss the time and space complexity of each method.  
𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝟏𝟓-𝟐𝟎 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐬): Start coding only after confirming the approach. Use proper naming, indentation, and spacing. Verbalize your thought process while coding.  
𝐃𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐠𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐄𝐝𝐠𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 (𝟓-𝟕 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐬): Before running the code, do a dry run with a custom test case. Check edge cases. If you spot a bug, stay calm and debug logically.  
𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 & 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞): After coding, explain the time and space complexity. If possible, suggest optimizations.
